key points of change
- Better UI
- Better navbar w/ user navbar links
- Better todo list
- taking out the blog feature(maybe)
- different login style
- Profile will be set up differently.



- dynamic background
- different daily quotes
- try to connect to a search engine like google or edge
- icons for each website link in navbar

Todo
- name, description, time created and due date(if needed)

database rules
- td_id
- td_name
- td_text
- user_name

to get the favicon from website, look for domain.com/favicon.ico (This Will help with the saved links)
